# FinClub-Credit-card-default-prediction-
This project was undertaken as part of the Finclub Summer Project 2025 with 
the objective of supporting Bank A in improving its credit risk management.  
The bank provided a dataset containing anonymized records of over 30,000 
credit card customers. The goal was to predict whether a customer would 
default  
on their credit card payment in the upcoming month. Accurate prediction 
enables the bank to preemptively reduce risk exposure and enhance 
operational strategies. 
The problem was framed as a binary classification task, with the target variable 
`next_month_default` taking a value of 1 if the customer defaults and 0 
otherwise. In addition to predictive modeling, a significant focus was placed on 
exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract financially meaningful insights and to 
construct new meaningful features.
